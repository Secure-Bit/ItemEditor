<h1>ItemEditor</h1>
<p>
    <b>Refined ItemStack manipulation â€’ lightweight, flexible and useful.</b><br>
    A compact and intuitive command structure makes modifying ItemStacks faster than ever before.
    It's free and open source.
</p>

<h2>Why this Project?</h2>
<p>
    It's obvious that ItemEditor isn't the first plugin providing several options to modify ItemStacks.
    But we decided to start hacking on this project, because a good user experience through <i>simplified controlling</i> is an important aspect.
    Besides, it's our goal to implement more complex features like modification of NBT tags in a simple way without tons of sourcecode.
    Finally, we want to make ItemEditor available for free for everyone instead of creating a charged project, which needs to be purchased before using.
